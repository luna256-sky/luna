"About Me"
#Luna
I am a fast leaner.Picking up concepts that are often described as **difficult** has always been easy for me
but the schocking thing is basic concepts often considereed as *simple*I find challenging. At first l was
annoyed,who wouldn't be, but l eventually got used to it and often just left the simple tasks to someone else.
I like -drawing
       -dancing
       -singing
>I hate crowded places or being the center of attention
I find the computer language being intreresting especially python
```python
print("Today is a great day!")
```
can not wait to learn more about it.
